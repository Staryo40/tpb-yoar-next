# TPB Yoar NextJS

This is a repository of my first "full" scale website that has been refactored from Vite to Next.js. 

In this version of the TPB Yoar project, there is *no backend functionality* and is strictly to showcase the frontend aspect of the project.

This is due to the full stack version of TPB Yoar using Strapi, which is a headless CMS that acts as the database for the project being unstable and needs to be refactored using a different CMS to make it work.

Should you be interested in the full stack version's code, you can check it here: https://github.com/Staryo40/tpb-yoar-vite-legacy.git

## What is this project?

Originally this is my personal project that I wanted to deploy in order to share about college materials that I got during my first year in ITB (TPB)

After making the fully functional website, there were troubles writing the materials. In addition to that, I made the website too wide in scope that makes it hard to maintain in the future should I continue it.

Thus, I scrapped the project altogether and plan to make a better version that is more well thought of in the future.

For now, I present to you this refactored version to show you my past work. This project has failed to meet it's original purpose. But from a website functionality perspective, I consider this project as a success. Thus, I hope this will give the viewer a picture of what I have worked on in the past.

## What technology is used?

1. React
2. Typescript
3. Vanilla CSS
4. Vite (in the original version)
5. NextJS (in the refactored version)
6. Strapi/headless CMS (in the original version)
